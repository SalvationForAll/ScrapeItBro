//This folder contains all the files of the code and its results
2 PHP files (source code)
3 CSV Files (Analysis)
1 Json File
1 Word Document
1 Requirements File
1 Read Me File

//Below is all the necessary steps and assumptions to run the code.

Assumptions: 
You have a .zip file by the name of myscrapeproject.zip 
You have Unpacked the zip file already
If you donot have xampp and/or any php supported IDE in your system then follow step 1 and 2 else skip to 3.



1) First install xampp in C:\ drive of your system. Below is the link from where you can install the latest version both for windows and mac OS.
https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

2) This task was performed on SublimeText editor so install that on your system if already not installed. (Although it would work in any other PHP supported IDE). In any case below is the link to download sublime text editor.
https://www.sublimetext.com/3

3) After xampp installation you will see a new folder in your C:\ drive by the name of xampp. Open it and then search for xampp-control.

4) You will see xampp application window, start your Apache server. 

5) Goto htdocs, paste the folder that contains your code. (In your case it should be by the name of myscrapeproject).

5) Once your server is up and running, open any browser (Firefox or Chrome), type in localhost/myscrapeproject and hit enter.

6) To see the data analysis results open browser and type loccalhost/myscrapeproject/analysis.php


NOTE: Remember you have to perform the 5th step first in order to perform 6th step since 5th one creates the json file of the data and then 6th performs the operations on it. 
NOTE: 5th step takes quite some time (5mins50secs to be precise) in order to collect data from scraping. So please be patient for the step to be completed.
